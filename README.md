# FiioFileDropper #
Using this tool you can create playlists for and on the FiiO X1.
To do so, connect the device to your PC, enter the path to the FiiO
storage in "Root Folder". You may specify an audiofile which can act as pause.
This file must also be located on your FiiO device.

## Why ##
One may ask: Why you need this crap? The answer might sound stupid as well:
You can create a playlist with pauses which you can record as Mixtape to an
old compact cassette. You can create a mix which will fit on your cassette
and has pauses as needed for music search on such old devices.
